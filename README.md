# monkey
Functional iterator (ala underscore.js, forEach, map, reduce, etc) but for trees

# Why monkey? Why Prim8?
Because they likes to climb trees!

# Not implemented
Methods which are not implemented due to not making much sense in a tree
as opposed to a flat array/map:

* indexOf (alternative implemented is pathTo)
* findIndex
* lastIndexOf (alternative implemented is lastPathTo)
* findLastIndex
