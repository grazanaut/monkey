# monkey/prim8
Functional iterator (ala underscore.js, forEach, map, reduce, etc) but for trees

# Why _monkey_? Why _prim8_?
Because they likes to climb trees! This thing loves to climb trees

# What specifically does it do?
Tree-equivalent versions of:
- forEach
- find
- findLast 
- some
- every
- map
- reduce
- pathTo (similar to indexOf, but for trees)
- lastPathTo (similar to lastIndexOf, but for trees)


# Not implemented
Methods which are not implemented due to not making much sense in a tree
as opposed to a flat array/map:

* indexOf (alternative implemented is pathTo)
* findIndex
* lastIndexOf (alternative implemented is lastPathTo)
* findLastIndex
