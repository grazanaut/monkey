# monkey
Functional iterator (ala underscore.js, forEach, map, reduce, etc) but for trees

# Why _monkey_? Why _prim8_?
This thing loves to climb trees

# Not implemented
Methods which are not implemented due to not making much sense in a tree
as opposed to a flat array/map:

* indexOf
* findIndex
* lastIndexOf
* findLastIndex
